       ____________________ Start of Makefile __________________________

	# define default target (first target = default)
	# it depends on 'hello.o' (which will be created if necessary)
	# and hello_func.o (same as hello.o)

	hello: hello.o hello_func.o
        	gcc -Wall hello.o hello_func.o -o hello

	# define hello.o target
	# it depends on hello.c (and is created from it)
	# also depends on hello_api.h which would mean that
	# changing the hello.h api would force make to rebuild
	# this target (hello.o).
	# gcc -c: compile only, do not link

	hello.o: hello.c hello_api.h
        	gcc -Wall -c hello.c -o hello.o

	# define hello_func.o target
	# it depends on hello_func.c (and is created from)
	# and hello_api.h (since that's its declaration)

	hello_func.o: hello_func.c hello_api.h
        	gcc -Wall -c hello_func.c -o hello_func.o

	# for above line TAB is must 

       ____________________ End of Makefile ____________________________

* Comments are lines that start with the #-character.

* A line that starts at column 0 (start of the line) and contains a
  colon character (:) is considered a rule. The name on the left side of
  the colon is created by the commands. This name is called a target.
  Any filenames specified after the colon are the files that the target
  depends on. They are called prerequisites (i.e. they are required to exist,
  before make decides to create the target.

* Lines starting with the TAB are commands that make will run to achieve
  the target.

* The first target given in a makefile is the default target.

* The order of filenames that make attempts to open is :
	 GNUMakefile, Makefile and finally makefile.
